🩺 Diabetes Prediction App

A Machine Learning web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-input medical data. This app uses KNN, Decision Tree, and MLP Neural Network models, and is built with Streamlit for an interactive UI experience.

🔍 Overview

This project helps users determine whether a person is diabetic or not by inputting standard health parameters. It's ideal for learning applied machine learning, working with medical datasets, and deploying real-world data apps.
